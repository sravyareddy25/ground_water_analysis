# ground_water_analysis
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis on groundwater data for different states in India. The analysis provides insights into groundwater extraction, availability, allocation, and distribution at both the state and district levels.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains the following information:

State-wise groundwater extraction
Annual groundwater availability
Groundwater allocation to districts
The dataset is available in the file groundwater_data.csv. It is a comma-separated values (CSV) file that can be easily imported and analyzed using various data analysis libraries.
